# Project Outline
This is a project that attempts to produce a colour band showing the most dominant colour of each frame in a youtube video.

## Process
- Locate and download an mp4 from youtube
- Segment the mp4 file into individual frames saved as .png images
- Loop through each frame in a folder and obtain the most dominant colour in rgb format
- Using the rgb value convert it into a colour which is appended to a chart that will then show the transformation of colour as the video/ frames progress
- Once an image has been produced the mp4 and frame image files will then be removed from the machine as they can take up a lot of space
